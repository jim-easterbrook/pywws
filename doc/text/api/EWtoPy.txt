Introduction
============

This program converts data from the format used by the EasyWeather
program supplied with the weather station to the format used by pywws.
It is useful if you've been using EasyWeather for a while before
discovering pywws.

The ``EasyWeather.dat`` file is only used to provide data from before
the start of the pywws data. As your weather station has its own
memory, you should run LogData.py before EWtoPy.py to minimise use of
the EasyWeather.dat file.

EWtoPy.py converts the time stamps in EasyWeather.dat from local time
to UTC. This can cause problems when daylight savings time ends, as
local time appears to jump back one hour. The program attempts to
detect this and correct the affected time stamps, but I have not been
able to test this on a variety of time zones.


Detailed API
============

Convert EasyWeather.dat data to pywws format.

usage: python EWtoPy.py [options] EasyWeather_file data_dir options
are:

   -h or --help            display this help

EasyWeather_file is the input data file, e.g. EasyWeather.dat data_dir
is the root directory of the weather data

This program assumes that EasyWeather used your local time, and
converts time stamps to UTC. This can create ambiguities when the
clocks go back in October, which the program attempts to detect and
correct.
